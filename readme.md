# Octo mode for Emacs

Major mode for Octo; a high level assembly language for the
[Chip8](http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html) virtual machine.

More information about the language can be found
[here](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo).

## Installation

[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/octo-mode-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/octo-mode)

The easiest way to install octo-mode is from melpa.  Assuming MELPA is added to
your archive list you can list the available packages by typing <code>M-x
list-packages</code>, look for <code>octo-mode</code>, mark it for installation
by typing <code>i</code> and then execute (install) by typing <code>x</code>. Or
install it directly with <code>M-x package-install RET octo-mode</code>.

If you want to install it manually, just drop this file anywhere in your
<code>load-path</code>. Be default octo-mode associates itself with the
<code>*.8o</code> file ending. You can enable the mode manually by <code>M-x
octo-mode RET</code>.

commit and rebase your branch on this repository's master branch to avoid
interleaved commits from different branches.
